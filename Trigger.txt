TRIGGER :
	Context
		System and User. Trigger will run System Mode Only.

	Context Variables
		IsExecuting, isBefore, isAfter, New, NewMap, Old, OldMap, isInsert, isUpdate, isDelete
	Best Prctice To write Trigger.
		Always Write Single Trigger for Object. As per salesforce documentation, there is no confirmation of executing sequence of Trigger.
		Try to write  bulkify trigger.
		Always use context variable
		Try to avoid SOQL and DML in trigger itself.
		Try to write all logic in helper class
		Write test class for trigger. code coverage should be at least 1 %
	Calling API from Trigger.
		we can callout rest api in trigger using @future(callout=true)
		We can check if this is Future Method or not using System.isFuture
	We can show Error message using addError() method.
	
	Syntax:
	Trigger myTrigger on Account(before Insert, before Update)
	{
	   if(Trigger.isBefore)
		{
		 if(Trigger.isInsert)
		 {
		    for(Account act : Trigger.New)
			{
